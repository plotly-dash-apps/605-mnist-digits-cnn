This repo takes code from the following tutorials: 

* [Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras)

More info about MNIST:

* The [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

* Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. State-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks. There is a listing of the state-of-the-art results and links to the relevant papers on the MNIST and other datasets on [Rodrigo Benensonâ€™s webpage](https://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#4d4e495354).
