    "\n",
    "The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. State-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks. There is a listing of the state-of-the-art results and links to the relevant papers on the MNIST and other datasets on Rodrigo Benenson’s webpage."

    "\n",

Performance on the train and validation dataset over each run can then be plotted to provide learning curves and insight into how well a model is learning the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras API supports this by specifying the “validation_data” argument to the model.fit() function when training the model, that will, in turn, return an object that describes model performance for the chosen loss and metrics on each training epoch.\n",

    "In order to estimate the performance of a model on the problem in general, we can use k-fold cross-validation, perhaps five-fold cross-validation. This will give some account of the models variance with both respect to differences in the training and test datasets, and in terms of the stochastic nature of the learning algorithm. The performance of a model can be taken as the mean performance across k-folds, given the standard deviation, that could be used to estimate a confidence interval if desired.\n",

    "We can use the KFold class from the scikit-learn API to implement the k-fold cross-validation evaluation of a given neural network model.

    "\n",
    "We know some things about the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we know that the images are all pre-aligned (e.g. each image only contains a hand-drawn digit), that the images all have the same square size of 28×28 pixels, and that the images are grayscale.\n",

    "Therefore, we can load the images and reshape the data arrays to have a single color channel.\n",
